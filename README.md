   - Uses a simple form via the Formik library.
   - Simultaneously checks for validation as the user inputs data.
   - Validation schema is generated by Yup.
   - Validation-related error messages are displayed below the corresponding input fields.

   - Each request is handled by separate hooks for the module.
   - Utilizes a generic fetcher for handling all API requests.
   - Exceptions from API calls are shown as error toasts with messages from the backend.
